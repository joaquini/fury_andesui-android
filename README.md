## Considerations

* All components were thought to follow similar implementation patterns, make sure you familiarize with a few of them before implementing a new one, you should follow the same methodologies as the previous components.
* Each component should have an entry on the wiki, if you are adding or updating one, please add the changes to the related entry.
* Bugs or feature requests should be submitted at our GitHub Issues section.

## Requirements

This library needs Android API 19+ (4.4+) to work.

## How to make a local publish

``
./gradlew build publishToMavenLocal
``

Pro tip: First change the version name in gradle.properties to X.XX.X-LOCAL (Note that we use [SemVer](https://semver.org/)).

## DON'Ts

Weâ€™re aligned with [these concepts](https://proandroiddev.com/how-to-maximize-androids-ui-reusability-5-common-mistakes-cb2571216a9f). Please be sure to follow them:
* Avoid using Business Models inside custom views.
* Avoid monolithic views.
* Avoid business logic in custom views.
* Avoid over-optimization (readable code is better than optimized code!)
* Avoid neglecting our UI in code reviews.
